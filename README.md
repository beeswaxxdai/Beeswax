# Introducing WAX
$WAX juxtaposes an already popular non-inflationary farming model to the xDAI chain taking advantage of the sidechain's expedient & infinitesimal fees for transfers, staking and overall smart contract operations while also expanding dimensions for arbitrage.

# Initial Distribution

The CORE team is kickstarting the initial distribution with a liquidity event. Contribute HNY to the WAX token during LGE to receive tokens, and the contributed HNY will be matched and added to the Honeyswap liquidity pool. Note that once added, liquidity tokens can not be removed from the WAX LP pools. This is by design. Read on to learn about why..

# **Deflationary Farming**

Farming tokens have a problem for their owners. To keep users farming, they have to mint more ever more coins. This completely destroys the value of the underlying token, due to excessive inflation. It's easy to find examples of this across the DeFi ecosystem. 

Our solution is called deflationary farming, and it is quite simple in only two steps:

1. Charge a fee on token transfers
2. Users can earn the fee by farming

This simple process means that those holding tokens are able to farm without infinite inflation.

# Keeping **Liquidity Liquid**

All transfers have to be approved by the WAX Transfers smart contract, which will block all
liquidity withdrawals from Honeyswap. This will guarantee a stable market, giving holders and farmers skin in the game.

# **Real Governance**

WAX is designed for great community governance. The communtiy decides everything, from developer fees, to deciding on the fee approver contract, adding new pools, rebalancing, and even disabling pools in the WAX Transfer contract.

If the holders decide BeeswaxVault should have a YFI pool, we can set
the ratio of fees it will be able to distribute, as well as when people should be
able to withdraw YFI tokens from it.

This creates an incentive to hold even more WAX by the holders of YFI tokens. Let the governance begin.

# **2400 CORE Forever**

Theres absolutely no way to create new WAX tokens. This means the
circulating supply can only ever go down, period.
